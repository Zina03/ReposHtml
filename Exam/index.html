        <p class="section-subtitle">
            <strong>Milky Way Galaxy</strong>
            , large spiral system consisting of several hundred billion stars, one of which is the Sun. It takes its
            name from the Milky Way, the irregular luminous band of stars and gas clouds that stretches across the sky
            as seen from Earth. Although Earth lies well within the Milky Way Galaxy (sometimes simply called the
            Galaxy), astronomers do not have as complete an understanding of its nature as they do of some external star
            systems. A thick layer of interstellar dust obscures much of the Galaxy from scrutiny by optical telescopes,
            and astronomers can determine its large-scale structure only with the aid of radio and infrared telescopes,
            which can detect the forms of radiation that penetrate the obscuring matter.

        <br>

        <p class="section-subtitle">Dark Matter! For galaxy creation to be successful, we first need a mysterious
            substance known as dark
            matter. Astronomers don’t know what dark matter is made of exactly but they do know it’s invisible and takes
            up most of the matter in the Universe. Dark matter, which will be shaped as a huge sphere around your galaxy
            and also sprinkled throughout your galaxy, seems to trigger the growth of clouds of gas and dust. Galaxy
            creators would need to shape the dark matter into a super-galactic-sized sphere. This dark matter will then
            weakly attract hydrogen gas and trigger the birth of the first stars. Be sure to stand back, as that first
            generation of stars can go out with a bang, with many supernova explosions occurring.

        <p class="section-subtitle">
            Gas! What are the other materials that go into making a galaxy? As mentioned above, clouds of gas and dust
            are believed to have eventually collapsed under their own gravitational pull to form the Milky Way’s first
            stars. So we need enough hydrogen gas to create a few billion stars.</p>
        <p class="section-subtitle">
            The Milky Way is shaped like a giant fried egg. It is about a hundred times wider than it is thick, and it
            bulges in the middle. The central lump is called the bulge and the rest of the galaxy outside the bulge is
            called the disk.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="section-subtitle">
            As you know, we are inside the Milky Way Galaxy. So when you look at the thin milky-looking band stretching
            across the sky at night, what do you think you are actually looking at?
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="section-subtitle">
            The thin band of light that you see is actually the stars in the Sagittarius arm as you look inwards towards
            the centre of the galaxy. There are so many stars densely packed together that you cannot make out
            individual stars with your eyes. There before you just see a haze of light. Above and below the plane of the
            disk there are very few stars.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="section-subtitle">
            If you look closely at the image of the Milky Way above, you can see several round fuzzy blobs dotted about
            above and below the disk. These are called globular clusters and are vast collections of hundreds of
            thousands of ancient stars tightly packed together by gravity. The Milky Way has an estimated 160 globular
            clusters. The oldest stars in the galaxy are found in these globular clusters, some are almost as old as the
            Universe itself.
