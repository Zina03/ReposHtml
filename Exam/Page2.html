            There are many galaxies besides ours, though. There are so many, we can’t even count them all yet! The
            Hubble Space Telescope looked at a small patch of space for 12 days and found 10,000 galaxies, of all sizes,
            shapes, and colors.
            Some scientists think there could be as many as one hundred bilion galaxies in the universe.

            Some galaxies are spiral-shaped like ours. They have curved arms that make it look like a pinwheel. Other
            galaxies are smooth and oval shaped. They’re called elliptical galaxies. And there are also galaxies that
            aren’t spirals or ovals. They have irregular shapes and look like blobs. The light that we see from each of
            these galaxies comes from the stars inside it.

            Sometimes galaxies get too close and smash into each other. Our Milky Way galaxy will someday bump into
            Andromeda, our closest galactic neighbor. But don’t worry. It won’t happen for about five billion years. But
            even if it happened tomorrow, you might not notice. Galaxies are so big and spread out at the ends that even
            though galaxies bump into each other, the planets and solar systems often don’t get close to colliding.

        <h1 class="questions"><strong>What is a galaxy, anyway? </strong></h1>
        <br>
        <p class="section-subtitle">Our galaxy is a gravitationally bound collection of stars, swirling in a spiral
            through space. Based on the deepest images obtained so far, it’s one of about 2 trillion galaxies in the
            observable universe. Groups of them are bound into clusters of galaxies, and these into superclusters; the
            superclusters are arranged in immense sheets stretching across the universe, interspersed with dark voids
            and lending the whole a kind of spiderweb structure. Our galaxy probably contains 100 to 400 billion stars,
            and is about 100,000 light-years across. That sounds huge, and it is, at least until we start comparing it
            to other galaxies. Our neighboring Andromeda galaxy, for example, is some 220,000 light-years wide. Another
            galaxy, IC 1101, spans as much as 4 million light-years.
