            <strong>Solar system</strong>
            , assemblage consisting of the Sun—an average star in the Milky Way Galaxy—and those bodies
            orbiting around it: 8 (formerly 9) planets with about 210 known planetary satellites (moons); countless
            asteroids, some with their own satellites; comets and other icy bodies; and vast reaches of highly tenuous
            gas and dust known as the interplanetary medium.

        <br>
        <p class="section-subtitle">
            The Sun, Moon, and brightest planets were visible to the naked eyes of ancient astronomers, and their
            observations and calculations of the movements of these bodies gave rise to the science of astronomy. Today
            the amount of information on the motions, properties, and compositions of the planets and smaller bodies has
            grown to immense proportions, and the range of observational instruments has extended far beyond the solar
            system to other galaxies and the edge of the known universe. Yet the solar system and its immediate outer
            boundary still represent the limit of our physical reach, and they remain the core of our theoretical
            understanding of the cosmos as well. Earth-launched space probes and landers have gathered data on planets,
            moons, asteroids, and other bodies, and this data has been added to the measurements collected with
            telescopes and other instruments from below and above Earth’s atmosphere and to the information extracted
            from meteorites and from Moon rocks returned by astronauts. All this information is scrutinized in attempts
            to understand in detail the origin and evolution of the solar system—a goal toward which astronomers
            continue to make great strides.

        <h1 class="questions">How old is our Solar System? </h1>
        <br>
        <p class="section-subtitle">
            About 4.6 billion years ago, a giant cloud of dust and gas known as the solar nebula collapsed in on itself
            and began to form what would eventually become the solar system's sun and planets. Meteorites, or pieces of
            space rock that have fallen to Earth, have helped scientists figure out the age of the solar system. Some of
            these small pieces have broken off of moons or planets and can yield interesting scientific information
            about the chemistry and history of their home body. Others have been traveling around the solar system since
            its beginning, before the planets even existed. The Allende meteorite, which fell to Earth in 1969 and
            scattered over Mexico, is the oldest known meteorite, at 4.55 billion years old.

        <h1 class="questions">How did our Solar System Form? </h1>
        <br>
        <p class="section-subtitle">Scientists think the solar system formed when a nearby exploding star, called a
            supernova, triggered the collapse of the solar nebula. According to this theory, the explosion sent shock
            waves through space, and those shock waves pushed parts of the nebula closer together, leading to collapse.
            The supernova may have even seeded material into the nebula, Live Science previously reported. For instance,
            scientists have found that aluminum-26, an element formed only in the hearts of stars, most likely
            originated from a series of nearby supernovas, Live Science sister site Space.com reported.

        <h1 class="questions">Our Solar System's Planets? </h1>
        <br>
        <p class="section-subtitle">Eight confirmed planets and many dwarf planets(opens in new tab) orbit the sun.
            According to NASA(opens in new tab), "the order and arrangement of the planets and other bodies in our solar
            system is due to the way the solar system formed." Rocky materials could withstand the young sun's immense
            heat, so the first four planets — Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars — are small, with rocky surfaces. Beyond
            them, "materials we are used to seeing as ice, liquid or gas settled in the outer regions of the young solar
            system," NASA says, namely the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn and the ice giants Uranus and Neptune.
