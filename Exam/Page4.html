            <strong>Solar system planets, order and formation: A guide
            </strong>
            The order of the planets in the solar system, starting nearest the sun and working outward is the following:
            Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and then the possible Planet Nine.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="section-subtitle">
            The solar system extends from the sun, called Sol by the ancient Romans, and goes past the four inner
            planets, through the asteroid belt to the four gas giants and on to the disk-shaped Kuiper Belt and far
            beyond to the teardrop-shaped heliopause.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="section-subtitle">
            Scientists estimate that the edge of the solar system is about 9 billion miles (15 billion kilometers) from
            the sun. Beyond the heliopause lies the giant, spherical Oort Cloud, which is thought to surround the solar
            system.

            The inner four planets closest to the sun — Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars — are often called the
            "terrestrial planets" because their surfaces are rocky. Pluto also has a rocky, albeit frozen, surface but
            has never been grouped with the four terrestrials.

            The four large outer worlds — Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune — are sometimes called the Jovian or
            "Jupiter-like" planets because of their enormous size relative to the terrestrial planets. They're also
            mostly made of gases like hydrogen, helium and ammonia rather than of rocky surfaces, although astronomers
            believe some or all of them may have solid cores.

        <h1 class="questions"> WHAT IS (AND ISN'T) A PLANET? </h1>
        <br>

        <p class="section-subtitle">
            The IAU defines(opens in new tab) a true planet as a body that circles the sun without being some other
            object's satellite; is large enough to be rounded by its own gravity (but not so big that it begins to
            undergo nuclear fusion, like a star); and has "cleared its neighborhood" of most other orbiting bodies.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="section-subtitle">
            But that restrictive definition helped isolate what should and should not be considered a planet — a problem
            that arose as astronomers discovered more and more planet-like objects in the solar system. Pluto was among
            the bodies that didn't make the cut and was re-classified as a dwarf planet.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="section-subtitle">
            The problem with Pluto, aside from its small size and offbeat orbit, is that it doesn't clear its
            neighborhood of debris — it shares its space with lots of other objects in the Kuiper Belt. Still, the
            demotion of Pluto remains controversial.
